# Next Day Tasks and Reminders

## What We've Accomplished So Far

### Authentication System

- ✅ Implemented strong password validation with native Rails methods
- ✅ Fixed social authentication (Google and LinkedIn)
- ✅ Set up automatic email confirmation for social accounts
- ✅ Added user profile and account editing capabilities
- ✅ Replaced Letter Opener with MailCatcher for development email testing
- ✅ Added visible sign out button in the header
- ✅ Fixed Two-Factor Authentication implementation
- ✅ Implemented welcome emails for new users

## Tasks for Next Day

### High Priority

1. **Fix Remaining Authentication Issues**

   - Review and test the full authentication flow once more
   - Verify MailCatcher is working correctly
   - ⏳ Add CAPTCHA support for sign-in/sign-up forms - AWAITING CONFIRMATION

2. **User Management**

   - Start working on user profile system enhancements
   - Implement user invitation workflow
   - Build out user account settings UI components

3. **Authorization System**
   - Add Pundit for policy-based authorization
   - Create core Permission and Role models
   - Start implementing User-Role relationships

### Medium Priority

4. **Testing**

   - Set up RSpec test framework
   - Begin adding model tests for the User model
   - Add controller tests for authentication controllers

5. **Technical Debt**
   - Clean up any remaining debug code
   - Check for and fix any security vulnerabilities
   - Optimize database queries in the authentication process

## Environment Setup Reminders

### MailCatcher

To use MailCatcher for email testing:

```bash
# Install globally
gem install mailcatcher

# Start the server
mailcatcher

# Access web interface
open http://localhost:1080
```

### Development Server

```bash
# Start the Rails server
bin/rails server

# Or with the development environment explicitly specified
RAILS_ENV=development bin/rails server
```

### Database Operations

```bash
# Reset and seed the database if needed
bin/rails db:reset

# Run migrations
bin/rails db:migrate
```

## Useful Resources

- [OmniAuth Documentation](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki)
- [MailCatcher Website](https://mailcatcher.me/)
- [Rails Guides on Security](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html)

## Known Issues

- **Social Authentication Edge Cases**: Carefully test edge cases where a user might sign up with email first and then try to link a social account with the same email.
- **Email Delivery**: Monitor if all emails are properly delivered and caught by MailCatcher.
- **Password Complexity**: The current password requirements might be too strict for some users - consider adding a strength meter.

## Notes for Tomorrow

1. Start the day by running through the full authentication flow from a fresh database to ensure everything works together.
2. Consider adding more comprehensive logging to help with future debugging.
3. Review the UX of the authentication process for any improvements.
4. Make sure to look at the TaskList.md file to update progress and prioritize remaining tasks.
