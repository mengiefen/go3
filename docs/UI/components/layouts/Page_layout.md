# Page Layout 

Main paege layout is the very top level component that contains all other components in it. 

In desktop mode we will have a header, a side panel (mostly at left, for RTL languages it is at right), and a main panel.

the side panel should be expandible/collapsible and also resizable by drag and drop with a minimum width. 

side panel and main panel should be scrollable separately and not together.



In mobile mode the side panel is hidden by default and it can be opened by clicking a menu button.

also the header is not fixed. it is accessible only when scrolling all the way to top.
